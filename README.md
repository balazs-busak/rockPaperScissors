# rockPaperScissors
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors mini game, coded in JavaScript to play in your web browser. (Mozilla, Chrome recommended)

This game was made possible with the help of The Odin Project and serves as an assignment project.

This was my first ever JavaScript project. I have reworked it a few times, as after coming up with my own ideas that were correct, I checked other solutions and videos. Ended up using those instead in my final code as I understood their approach as well. 

I learned to use: functions, loops, syntaxes of js and keeping my code easy to read.

The project took me around 10 hours. Could have been done in less but I had limited amount of time to study, so often had to revise. Because of this learned how useful comments are, when I had to return after a long time off.
